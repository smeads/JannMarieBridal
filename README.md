##Jann Marie Bridal

I chose to build a simple web application for my wife and her business. She is a talented seamstress that specializes in making custom wedding dresses. I have provided a link to a video walk through below, but the gist of the application is an on-boarding solution for her and her clients. It is a simple and easy way for her clients to provide their specific measurements and other important information. It is also a great way for my wife to manage her clients and interact with them in a unique way. While this application is simple upfront, I can see it evolving into something greater over time.

While building this web application I was able to build on skills learned from previous bloc projects. I was able to better understand Devise and how to customize it for this application's particular features. I also took some time to customize the Bootstrap layout and styles by familiarizing myself with HTML and CSS syntax. Youâ€™ll see in the video below that I included a logo, several images, tables, a different color scheme, and more. I even honed in on TDD, however I still need a lot of work in this area. And lastly, the most important thing I did was ramp up my understanding of MVC and how each piece fits together. Specifically, I got more comfortable generating/changing database tables and running migrations.

All in all this project was an excellent opportunity for me to sharpen the skills developed over the past couple months. I look forward to what lies ahead as I know this is only the surface being scratched.
